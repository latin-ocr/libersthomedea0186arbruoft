a name which though now appropriated to the head-land on the
Fife side of the serry, must, from the description and boundarieS‚
have been applied to what is now known as Broughty and its
adjacent lands.1 These grants afford charter evidence of five
generations of this family: (1.) Earl Gillebride (apparently before
the foundation of Arbroath) hadmade a donation of the land of
Portincraig‚ with the fishing along its shoreS‚ for founding an
hospital at Portincraig. (2.) Earl Gillechrist, his son, appropriated
that land to the new Abbey, and his charter was successively ratified
by his son, (3.) Earl Duncan, his grandson, (4.) Earl Malcolm‚
and by (5.) Maud, Countess of Angus', in her own right.2

By gift of Marjory Countess of Buchan‚ the monks had the
church of T urfred or Turref3 from Ralf le Naym, the church of
Inverugy3 from Roger Bishop of St. AndreWS‚ the church of
Aberhelot or Arbirlot.

The De Berkeleys granted to the convent the church of In-

* verkelidor or Inverkeelor, which was confirmed by Ingelram de

Balliol, who married the daughter of Walter de Berkeley3 and
the lands of Balfeith or Belphe, with a description and bounding
