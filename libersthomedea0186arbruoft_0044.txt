have rubricated titles, and red numeraIS, and the order and divi-
sions of the work, down even ῖο the numeration of the charterS,
exactly correspond in both. The handwriting of the Ethie MS.
——a fine uniform square hand—is not later than the middle of the
reign of Alexander ΙΙΙ. There is not much reason to doubt that
these are the fragments of an original Register from which the
book now called Registrum Vetus is copied) Of the remaining
thirteen leaveS, ten are written in various handS, *all later than
the part above mentioned, but not later than the beginning of the
One of them is that of the writer of the body

of the Registrum Vetus,

reign of David II.
These leaves also contain charters of
Arbroath which are, with very few exceptions,2 contained also
in the Registrum Vetus,

The remaining part of these fragmentS, while itis by far the,
most interesting, is unfortunately the smallest. It consists of a

leaf of an early taxation of Scotch beneficeS‚ and of two lea'ves

¹ Even if it did not appear certain from the identity
of the arrangement, and divisions of the work, and from
the perfect correspondence of the numeration of char·
ters, many minute circumstances concur to prove that
the one is a copy of the other. For the most part,
where a chartei· is followed by a confirmation, the latter
is left unnumbered, and that in both. In the great
char-ter of Alexander II., one of the witnesses, Mal-
colm, Earl of Fife, is set down in the Ethie MS„
«ι eomite Maioolm. de rifi1f,” which in the Registrum
Vetus, is “ Comite Malcolm. de Fyfuff’ (N 0.100.) In the
following charter, in the clause of criminal jurisdic-
tion‚ the scribe of one Register has written “ cum
fureo et fossa‚’' instead of ‘⁶ cum furca,”—an error not
remarkable, were it not that it is exactly copied in

the other Register. When it is ascertained that one*

of the two is copied from the other, it is not doubtful
which is the original and which the copy. If the age
of the handwriting be* correctly stated above, it at
once set-s the question at rest3 but the priority does
not rest solely on that. A charter of inspeximus of
Henry, Prior of St. Andrews, has contained in yremio
the charter of a preceding Prior. Itis found so record-
ed in the Ethie MS. ; but the scribe of the Registrum
Vetus has left out the confirmed charter‚ with a mere
reference to its position as already recorded. It is
manifest that the writer of the Ethie Manuscript has
not copied that entry from the Registrum Vetus, and
it would seem to follow, that the, Registrum Vetus
is copied from the Ethie MS.
