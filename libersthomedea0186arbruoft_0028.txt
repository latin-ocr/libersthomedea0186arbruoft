xxn PREFACE.

Connected with this subject, we turn with much interest to the
indications of an early ‘⁶ extent” of land, or a measure or valua-
tion, having reference to public burdens. Some deeds would seem
to show a definite forinsec service, and a fixed amount of aid due
from landS, long before the· period which is generally assigned for the
introduction of the old extent. The very ancient denominations
of land, from its value-—librata‚ nummata, denar-iata terrce, plainly
point at a valuation for some public purpose3 but here there are
indications that the divisions into davachS, which have hitherto
been taken for mere agricultural measures of arable land, have
also reference to an early extent, expressed in measure of land,
not in money value;1 and these occur in 1234, without reference
to any recent measure of extent or taxation.

The public statutes of 1318, recorded in this Register——the only
body of general laws of the reign of Robert I.—derived additional
authority and interest, from the fact that Bernard‚ the Abbot of
Arbroath, 'as Chancellor of the kingdom, probably either framed
them, or presided in Parliament when they were passed, and thought
them of sufficient importance to have place in the Register of his
Abbey, amongst deeds more nearly concerning it.2

In another document, there is notice of the Abbot of Arbroath
passing to Norway on the King’s affairS, probably in connexion
with the negotiations which ended in the treaty of InverneSS‚
1312.3
