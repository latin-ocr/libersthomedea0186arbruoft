our forefatherS. Thus, a grant of a hostilage in Stirling presents us
with a fair picture of a lodging of the better sort in the four-
teenth century—a hall for meaIS, with tables and trestles and
other furniture3 a spence with a buttery3 one or more chambers
for sleeping; a kitchen, and a stable capable of receiving thirty
horseS. They burned candles of white tallow, which were com-
monly called Paris candleS. They used straw apparently for
bedding, and the hall and bed-chamber were strewed with rushes,l
But much more minute and curious illustrations of the manner
of living will be found in the succeeding part.

The chartulary is peculiarly rich in notices of the Culdees, At
Abernethy a conv'ent of them existed, though, perhaPS, in little
more but in name, to the end of the reign of William the Lion,
when they seem to have expired, and there is no trace of their
rights or claims having been transferred to St. Andrews.2 The
chapter of Brechin at first consisted entirely of those ColumbiteS.
The successive Bishops speak of them with affection as “ Keledei
nostri.” Towards the end of William’s reign, we find an infusion
of other clerks in the chapter; the Prior of the convent of Culdees
however being still the President.3 In 1248, the last year of the
reign of Alexander ΙΙ., the Culdees have disappeared altogether,
and the affairs of the Cathedral are managed ‚in the ordinary
modern form, by the Dean and Chapter.⁴

A few notices of forgotten saints are interesting to the Church
