he did not always testify great respect for the Pope. It has been
suggested that William was personally acquainted with Becket in
his early life, ‘⁶ when there was little probability of his ever be-
coming a confessor, martyr, and saint.”l Was this the cause, or
was it the natural propensity to extol him wh0‚ living and dead,
had humbled the Crown of England, that led William to take
Saint Thomas as his patron saint, and to entreat his intercession
when he was in greatest trouble ?² Or may we consider the dedi-
cation of his new Abbey, and his invocation of the martyr of
Canterbury, as nothing more than signs of the rapid spreading
of the veneration for the new saint of the high church party, from
which his old opponent himself was not exempt ?‘⁹'

The Abbey was founded for Tyronensian monks brought from
the monastery of Kelso, in 1178.4

,1. Reginam, a monk of Kelso, was the first Abbot of Ar-
broath.⁵ In 1178, the Abbot and Convent of Kelso quitclaimed
from all subjection and obedience, Reginald elected to be Abbot
of the church of St. Thomas in Scotland at Arbroath; declaring

not rest only on the authority of Camerarius, (De
jbrtitud. Sooc. p. 126, where he fairly makes a saint of
William‚) nor on his authority, Hector Boetius,
(lib. xii.) who nari-ates that “ cum illo magnam puer
consuetudinem habuerat.’' This fact is affirmed by
the Chronicler of Lanercost—Ob familiarem amorem
inter ipsum et Sanctum Thomam, dum adhuc in curia
regis Henrici esset contractum, divulgato in mundo et
approbato in coelo celebri ejus martyrio, abbatiam de
Aberbroutok in honore ipsius fundavit et redditibus
ampliavit. (p. 11.)

⁸ The story of King Henry’s pena-nce at the tomb of
Becket, coinciding exactly with the capture of his
enemy William at Alnwick, (which Lord Hailes criti-
cises too minutely‚) serves at least to show the popular
feeling, and perhaps Hem-y's willingness to take ad·
vantage of it. The miraculous coincidence was cer-
tainly believed universally in that age. (Claron. M ail ν,
Fordun. Gervase. M at. Paris, &c.)

to record (at the time) the benediction of the first
Abbot.
