PREFACE. xxi

Columbite family of Dunkeld—that Ethelred, a son of Malcolm
Canmore, Abbot of Dunkeld, was also Earl of Fife, our best histo-
rians have evaded the embarrassment by questioning the authority .
of the chronicler 3¹ and it has not hitherto been suspected that
there were proofs of another house of Culdees, even surviving
Saint David’s Church revolution, having its hereditary abbot, and
styling himself and acting, as Lord of the Abbey territory.

The evidence, indeed, is narrow, and may not be deemed satis-
factory, and this is not the place for rearing an argument upon it.
It raiseS, at least, an interesting speculation both for Scotland and
Ireland3 and independently of it, the historica] inquirer of both
countries will be pleased to meet the frequent notices of the old
Culdees both of Abernethy and of Brechin, which occur in this
Register.

The Register of Arbroath ha's preserved the most ancient evi-
dence of the form of judicia] procedure, as recorded in rolls of the
King's Court, the proceedings themselves being founded upon the
old laws of King David,—“ assisa regis David . . . usitata et pro-
bata in regno Scotiae usque ad illum diem.'’2

In a discussion regarding the service due to the Abbey for the
land of Innerpefir, we have some light thrown upon the nature of
the military service stipulated in ancient Scotch charterS, and
incidental mention of an expedition of Alexander II. into the
western Highlands in 1248, not elsewhere commemorated, with the

attendance of those bound to do military service.³
