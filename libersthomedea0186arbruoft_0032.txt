ml PREFACE.

A person of the name of Bricius occurs in very early charters as
‘⁶ judex” of AngUS, probably holding his office under the great
EarIS. In 1219, Adam was “judex” of the Earl’s court. Some
years later, he became “judex” of the King’s court, and his brother
Keraldus succeeded to his office in the court of the EarL for in
the year 1227, we find the brothers acting together, and styled
respectively “judex'’ of AngUS, and “judex '⁹ of our Lord the
King. The dwelling of Keraldus received the name of “ Kerald-
iston‚” now Caraldstoun ; and the office ofjudeX, becoming heredi-
tary and taking its Scotch style of “Dempster,'' gave name to
the family who for many generations held the lands of Caraldstoun,
and performed the office of Dempster of the Parliaments of Scot-
land. Its functions were no doubt of a very different kind and
degree from those fulfilled by the ancient Judex‚ and it might be
interesting to trace, from these and other materiaIS, the progress
of the change.

It has already been mentioned that much of the pedigree of the
ancient Earls of Angus is proved from this Register. lt affords
also valuable information for the genealogies of the de BerkeleyS‚
MalherbeS, de RossyS, WischardS‚ MiddletounS, ScotS, de BrechinS,
MelvilleS, ArbuthnotS‚ Sibbalds, MoncurS, MohautS, and other
houses of Angus and the MeamS, as well as of the Earls of
Buchan, and the names of Garuiach, le Cheyne‚ Leslie, F eodarg‚
Meldrum‚ Durward‚ Walchope, Monimusk‚ and St. MichaeL with

other ancient families in the North.
