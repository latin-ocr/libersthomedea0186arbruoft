William granted to Hugh de Roxburgh, the Chaucellor, in life-
rent, “ terram abbacie de MunrOS,'’ to be held of Arbroath for a
reddendo of three stones of waX. There was no Abbey at Mon-
trose‚ and we must look for the meaning of the grant in another
direction. In the great char-ter of Arbroath‚ the King granted
to it “ the church of Saint Mary, of old MunrOS, with the land
of that church‚ which in Scotch is called Abthen.'’¹ Again, early
in the thirteenth century, Malcolm, Earl of AnguS, granted to
NicholaS, son of the priest of Kerimure and his heirS, in fee and
heritage‚ the land of Abthein of Munifeith3 and the Countess
Maud, in her widowhood‚ confirmed that grant. There is nothing
here to connect the tenure with the Abbey3 but in 1310, Michael
de Monifoth, the hereditary lord of the land, (dominus abba-

thanie ejusdem‚) binds himself to pay to the convent of Arbroath‚

six shillings and eightpence of good and lawful sterlingS, for the

toft and croft which he holds of them in the territory of the
said abbathania, together with half a boll of mustard seed. This
toft was without doubt that which the Countess Maud describes
in her charter of gift to Arbroath‚ as “the land to the south
of the church of Monifod‚ which the Culdees held in my father’s
time.”2

Abthein, then, was land, the property of or connected with an
Abbot or Abbacy-—perhaps of a Columbite or Culdee house—but

whether any other quality or condition enters into its meaning,

there are too few materials yet to ascertain.
