By the gift of Thomas de Lundyn the Durward, (ostiarius
Regis‚) the monks obtained the church of Kinerny3 and the bank
of forest-land, lying at> the junction of the Dee and Canny, called
in the days of William the Lion ‘⁶ nemus de Trostauch,” and
which, now again under wood‚ has been known for many years to
the Deeside people as “ the Wood of Trustach? ’¹

Robert de LundreS‚ the bastard son of King William, bestowed
on the Abbey the church of Ruthven. 2 From the Malherbes it
received two oxgates in Rossy‚ and a rent of two shillings from the
