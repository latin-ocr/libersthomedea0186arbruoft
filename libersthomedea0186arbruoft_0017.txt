PREFACE.

THE date of the foundation of Arbroath is of some interest in
Church and public history. Thomas a Becket, the high church
Archbishop‚ was slain at the altar of his own church of Canter-
bury, on the 29th of December 1170. Two years after-
wardS, in 1173, he was canonized3 and within five years of his
canonization‚ and not more than seven from the period of his
death, in the year 1178st William King of Scotland had founded,
endowed, and dedicated to Saint Thomas the Martyr, the Abbey
of Arbroath.

William was no admirer of the Archbishop’s principles of
Church independence. His 'whole policy was opposed to them.
A contemporary Churchman accuses him of imitating the Norman

tyranny in controlling the disposal of Church preferment‚2 and
