the rapid Spey at Orkill. If we reflect how few of these sur-
vived the middle of the 14th century, and how long it waS, and by
what painful effortS‚ before they could be replaced in later timeS‚
we may form some idea of the great progress in civilization which
Scotland had made during the reign of William, and the peaceful
times of the two AlexanderS. We do *not know much of the intel-
lectual state of the population in that age, but regarding it only
in a material point of view, it may safely be affirmed that Scotland‚
at the death of King Alexander 111„ was more civilized and more
prosperous than at any period of her existence, down to the time,

when she ceased to be a separate kingdom in 1707.

Of the materials used for the present work, the two volumes
generally known as the ‘⁶ Registrum Vetus? and the ‘⁶ Registrum ’
Recentius” of Arbroath, have been long familiar to Scoteh
antiquarieS. They formed part of the collection of Sir James
Balfour, and are both now preserved in the Advocates’ Library
at Edinburgh. The former is a small folio or large octavo nummum vum.
volume'of vellum, of 138 numbered leaves.¹ The part of this
volume which may be considered as the ancient digested and
arranged record of the Abbey CharterS, to which a “ Tabula”

- (occurring at folio 34) correspondS, begins at folio 38, and ends
at folio 112 3⁷ that portion has rubricated numeraIS, as well as red
titles to the charterS. A not less ancient portion, as regards the

handwriting, and which may be viewed as an ancient supplement,

¹ Folios 12'and 13 are wanting, and so noted by Macfarlane’s transcriber in the middle of last century.
