PREFA GE. xxxui

of STATUTA C0N01LL11 Scor10AN1, which, imperfect as they are,
serve to place that code of ancient ecclesiastica] law upon a much q
better foundation than Lord HaileS, from the authorities known
in his time, could assert for it.¹ These are written in double
columnS, with coloured initial letterS, and in a hand not later
than the reign of Alexander III. They support, in their shape
and essentiaIS‚ the version found in the Register of Aberdeen‚
while they supply some omissionS, and furnish readings greatly
more correct. The leaves upon which they are written have
certainly formed part of a book of Record of the Abbey of
l Arbroath‚ and, to judge from the appearance of the vellum, of
the same volume whose fragments contain the rubricated and
ἷ numbered charters mentioned above.

Considering the Registrum Vetus as a record of the age of
Abbot Bernard‚ that period has been adopted as the limit of the
present volume, which will be found to embrace all the ancient
matter of the Registrum VetuS‚ as well as all the documents con-
tained in the other Registers mentioned, that are of dates earlier
than the end of the reign of Robert I.

In arranging these materials for the preSS, it has been thought omma or raum
proper to preserve the integrity, and even the shape and order of
the ancient Abbey Register, as it is found imperfectly in the Ethie
MS„ and more complete in the ‘⁶ Registrum VetuS.’' The body
of that Register isdivided into several headS‚ according to the

, ¹ “ Canons of the Church of Sootland,” and “Historical Memorials concerning the Provincial Councils of
the Scottish Clergy.” Effiburgh, 1769.
