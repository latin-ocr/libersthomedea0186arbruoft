ceeding one, whilst it traces down the descent of property, will
give much more minute and interesting details of the habits and
mannerS‚ and the whole social condition of the people of the

The buildings of the Abbey of Arbroath, begun in 1478, brought
near to their completion at the time of the dedication of its
church in 1233, through ,the decay of so many centurieS, in
spite of violence and long neglect⁷ and barbarous modern repairS, ·
still afford a few specimens of good Norman architecture, and
parts of several later styleS. In the middle of last century, Dr.
Johnson said “ he should scarcely have regretted his journey ” to
Scotland, “ had it afforded nothing more than the sight of Aber-

brothick.” The taste for church architecture had not then re-

vived among us; and Johnson’s was only an impression which
would have been produced by the associations of any ancient
ecclesiastical structure. The present state of the ruins, and of
the few remaining monuments of Arbroath‚ some plates of which
accompany the present volume, will be more particularly illustrated

in the following one.
